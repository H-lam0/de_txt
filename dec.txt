?œCandy wrapper, broken box, your mom?¦â€? I almost spit my coffee out
I knew you were a genius at the very beginning when you said: For people with ADHD, you can?™t just come in and start moving things around. They freak out because their stuff may be in a pile, but it?™s their pile and they know what?™s in it. That?™s ME!! I felt so validated. I love the way you speak about what you?™re doing when decluttering for folks WITH ADHD. Such respect you have. Thank you!!
Neurodivergent folks helping out other neurodivergent folks.  Just like we always have. Love it.
Asking for help is hard, finding understanding is priceless ?¤ï?
Honestly, hearing someone talk so respectfully about ADHD mess makes me genuinely emotional. I&#39;m not used to seeing people like me being treated so kindly. It&#39;s either judgement or pity. Never just &quot;here&#39;s how things are and how we&#39;re working with it&quot;.
I?™m married to an ADHD person. Years ago I created ?œBrad boxes??in all the rooms. 2 in the kitchen. So when I?™m cleaning I can throw his stuff in the Brad Boxes. It didn?™t take long for him to learn to look in those boxes first for any stuff he needs. Saves me time and saves me from constantly telling him where stuff is.   Then if company comes by I can move the boxes into an unused room.
Dude&#39;s a better psychologist than most psychologists.
I have been literally crying through this video. I have realized that I have ADHD recently. I married a man with ADHD and had two kids with ADHD. We are a mess, but we&#39;ll make it someday somehow.
"OMG! ADHD moment. When my son was in highschool, his room was a disaster area. I challenged him and said to him that I bet he didn&#39;t even know where {a thing, I think it was a moose} was. He was lying on his bed, and without even breaking eye contact with me calmly reached under his bed, grabbed the thing and handed it to me. I never complained about his room again ?????¤£. He&#39;s awesome by the way. ??,@sallyloda8038,8371

The random wolves and mooses that were part of this videos narrative really helped me not zone out (just an ADHD symptom, not intentional) of this video, so thank you :)
I really appreciate that you don&#39;t just see the clutter, but the humans behind it. Respecting people the way they are is something we need a lot more of in this world. Thanks for spreading the word, man!
I&#39;m 44, a mental health therapist, AND I have both ADHD and bipolar disorder. I have been shamed my whole life for the semi-organized chaos that I live in. The way that you approached this with such wonderful empathy and humor was, no lie, healing for me. I regret that I have only one account to subscribe with. You are truly a special person. Thank you! &lt;3
The out of sight out of mind thing is absolutely spot on.   - Adult with ADHD
These kinds of content almost bring me to tears because of how much of a struggle my ADHD has been.
&quot;If your friend comes over with depression, you wouldnt yell at them for being depressed.  And, if you do, they&#39;re the one that needs to find a new friend, not you.&quot;   Beautiful!!  Love how stern that line was delivered.
I started crying after you acknowledged that for people with ADHD even receiving help with things like cleaning or organizing can feel like the people in your life belittling you or looking at you as bad because you can?™t take care of it yourself. This is my daily reality, I wake up everyday wanting to clean my house and have everything organized, but feeling like it?™s useless because it?™s just going to become a mess again. Then the paralysis starts and it feels like you?™re suffocating just looking at it all and it?™s going to swallow you whole??it?™s getting better, learning to take care of what?™s right in front of me instead of everything that needs to be done, but sometimes that doesn?™t make me feel like any less of a failure for not getting it all done.   Thanks for the video, it?™s inspiring.
The DOOM piles are a way of putting all the visual chaos into one spot. It?™s an acronym for Didn?™t Organize, Only Moved. Each item in the pile will require extra brain energy, maybe because it doesn?™t have a designated spot or because there?™s a decision to make / action to take around it (like with mail, it may need a reply, and that?™s a separate task). When you don?™t have the time or energy in the moment, you add it to a pile or box or bag with things that need similar attention so you can handle it when you do have the time and energy. The piles are a strategy to manage stuff in the moment so it doesn?™t look so overwhelming. It?™s a constant struggle, so thank you for understanding and being compassionate.
I think your video ought to be required viewing for any person who is ostensibly &quot;helping&quot; another person, regardless of mental disability. You are so respectful of your clients. Within the past five years I retired, was diagnosed with an incurable0 condition, sold my house, had to give up driving, and moved to  another state to be closer to my only child, his wife, and their two kids. I was severely depressed for several years, snd could not bring myself to take care of my house. I was honestly surprised that neither my son nor his wife had a clue as to how to help me. They &quot;helped&quot; by throwing out things that they decided I didn&#39;t need anymore, and made it clear that they would do things &quot;their way&quot;, or not at all. I never felt so judged and shamed as I did then. I wish I had known about your service as I would have hired you on the spot. Thank you for the respect I felt for the feelings that any person with a mental disability would feel. Your &quot;help&quot; would be truly helping.
I live in an ADHD household, and I also keep my ninja weapons on the counter, my brother tried to put the moose on the counter today and I had to explain to him that the moose will become too confident and attempt to overthrow the household. It?™s just too risky
This should be required viewing by all psychiatrists, psychologists, teachers, and parents, oh, and other cleaners of course!
 a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HjkBfmO8SQ&amp;t=67">1:07   I respect you.   It is not laziness   It is not immaturity   We are only going throw away real garbage.   Thank you for respecting them.
As a person who has severe ADHD and generalized anxiety I can say with absolute confidence you know what you?™re talking about. You absolutely know what you?™re doing and I can so relate to how you?™re organizing. I need someone like you in my life. You are absolutely incredible, amazing, awesome, and I wish I?™d known about your channel and your work years ago. I?™m in the pacific northwest .
Coming from a kid who didn&#39;t know she had ADHD and had to grow up through the names of being &quot;lazy,&quot; &quot;messy,??a &quot;hoarder,&quot; thank you for doing this. It&#39;s very justifying and makes me feel like a human, and seen!! Thank you thank you thank you
As a person who has ADHD the &quot;items become decorations&quot; is huge for me! I&#39;ve actually gotten into the habit of finding decorative bottles and trays to put my day to day things in so that it&#39;s still visually attractive (for example my spices and teas all have to be out but I&#39;m working on making them look like apothecary bottles)
My wife has autism and I have ADHD. I?™m not joking when I say I cried watching this video. Feeling seen and validated in the difficulties of having an organized house.
"I learned I had ADHD through dating someone with it. My family called me lazy, a hoarder, etc growing up and I didn&#39;t feel like those were the reasons but I knew something was different about me and how I operate. I learned I share the same traits as them 1:1 and the pieces all started to click. I&#39;ve come a long way, I still struggle a lot but learning the things that get me moving (like watching your videos, making task lists, reward systems for myself etc) help me make improvements in my life that hopefully can become habits. Thank you for sharing these videos. ??,@ANA-gh5do,7
28,Ugxhwy9vfl6Hf5l_g8F4AaABAg,2024-04-20T14:37:44Z,-HjkBfmO8SQ,This was my house four months ago. In November I was diagnosed with adhd at 37 years old. With medication and dedication every day I have finally sorted through a lifetime of my belongings. Decluttering"
I wasn&#39;t expecting quality dry humor in an accurate how-to video for ADHD-friendly organization, but it was a pleasant and welcome surprise
