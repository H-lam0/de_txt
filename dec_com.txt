&quot;Can I live without it&quot; is brilliant! Thank you!
Also a good one is, Would I buy this again? Makes you really think especially with today&#39;s prices!
also ?œdo i have space for this??when buying a new thing is a good one to ask too
I am the child of hoarders who were both children of hoarders, and that instinct runs strong in me. One of the things my husband did for me was ask, &quot;can we replace it when needed easier than we can store it until needed?&quot;  He also asked, &quot;what do you want more: not having to run a mile up the road to re buy that at the dollar store, or the peace of mind you get from having a manageable amount of stuff?&quot; One trap I still fall into is the perceived value of things: I paid for it, searched hard to get it, it must be worth a lot so I can&#39;t let go of it unless I get $$$ for it.  It&#39;s easier to not bring something home than it is to get rid of it later.
I read a quote ?œit?™s better to have LESS than organise MORE????it stuck with me!    Has been Super helpful!!
On the very day I moved into my current apartment all my things were stolen out of my moving truck. All of my furniture + many packed boxes. Naturally I was very upset and couldn?™t afford to replace all of it. Within 1 month I started liking the look of my place without all the stuff. I bought 1 chair and lots of plants and I do have my artwork on the walls. I honestly love it this way, super minimalist. 18 months later people ask if I just moved in, if my things are in storage. Lol.
That&#39;s so true. You can justify the &quot;do I need it ?&quot; with a &quot;yes&quot;. &quot;Can I live without it&quot; ? Surprisingly often&quot;yes&quot;.??
I love that term...minimalish. ?? I feel like that&#39;s what I&#39;m striving toward.
I started to ask myself ?œwhen was the last time I even used/worn this??and it has been such a life changer. Working in retail you have a tendency to buy clothes and anything on sale with your employee discount. Since freelancing, I have realized there are things I haven?™t used or worn in literal YEARS! So every so often I go through things and call a church to pick up for donations.
I imagine myself dying and my family being forced to go through my stuff. So I&#39;m always trying to get rid of things, and make due with what I have instead of buying more. If you&#39;ve ever been the one to go through a loved one&#39;s home after their passing, then you know we all accumulate way too much stuff.
"Oh my gosh...Truth. lol I&#39;ve been purging massively for the past few months. I feel like I am in an uphill battle. I have so much more to go. There are about ten young moms at my husband&#39;s job that really need donations of everything. It makes me feel so good when he tells me how they gasp, and can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m giving them and get so excited  looking through everything. They then bring pictures of their family&#39;s to show my husband and they say, my family thanks you. Big difference from Goodwill and St Vincent De Paul, you pull up to drop donations, two guys look at each other in slight disgust and start eye rolling.  Knowing I&#39;m helping all of these young moms w everything they need, motivates me to even give things away that I still love, because I know they will love it even more.  Your house is so clean and beautiful ??,@lauracress206,474
11,Ugzshd6U3DxQn-1zG-N4AaABAg,2024-06-21T00:26:28Z,7SCX5do5GmY,I ask myself &quot;is it worth my time&quot;? Is it worth my time cleaning"
I became a minimalist on accident.. long story short.. my fiancÃ© died unexpectedly and I had no one there to help me move so I literally had to get rid of EVERYTHING . I could only take what I could fit in my car and I drove from California to Tennessee where my mom was.  Now I realize I didn?™t need all of that stuff and I am very conscious of what I buy now
This is GREAT advice. If I?™m afraid I might regret letting it go I put it outta sight, give myself a time, if I haven?™t used it by the date I gave myself, it?™s gone!
"For me, ?œdo I use this???Is the best question. And the follow-up would probably be ?œdo I have something else that could be multi-purpose and take the place of the item in question???,@deeeno6867,222
15,UgxpDnZLUB9DyEFEfC14AaABAg,2024-09-01T00:27:05Z,7SCX5do5GmY,My late father used to say &quot;Satisfy your needs - but don&#39;t invent more of them!&quot; If only he (and my late mum) had adhered to his own preaching ?? 4 years in and we are still decongesting their house ?¤·?»?â?ï¸?It was filled to the brim (basement to rooftop) and we can&#39;t just throw everything out in bulk"
I FOUND OUT form my granddaughter now that she&#39;s grown she didn&#39;t bring friends  to my house because she was embarrassed because of all the clutter  I CAN&#39;T GET THAT LITTLE GIRL BACK EVER   Remember  Simple living IS all they ask for THEN you have time for THEM   Instead of spending ALL YOUR DAYS cleaning and organizing never getting rid of stuff  1. I enjoyed these THING&#39;S now its someone else&#39;s time  2. IT&#39;S BETTER TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE.  (My personal matra) 3. things are not the most important things in life 4. do I love this enough to take up space in my house 5. do I have a home for this  6. What really is most important to me in my life 7. AM I spending more time cleaning and organizing than I am with God and my family ? ?¥º did for 40 yrs DON&#39;T LET THAT BE YOU ?˜¢
I&#39;d say Marie Kondo&#39;s &quot;does this spark joy for me?&quot; is a better question for me in most situations. It kind of encapsulates the &quot;can I live without it?&quot;, but coupled with more emotion. I&#39;m very emotional and get emotionally attached easily, and the phrasing of your question feels too emotionally detached in my mind. Glad you found something that works for you though! ?¥°
I&#39;m adding this question to my list. I also ask myself... 1.WHY did I get it?   2. What am I going to do with it?   3.When have (or did) I used it? 4. How is this helping me  move forward in my life?  5.What emotions are keeping me attached to this?  I have cleared out so much. For me, different items require different questions...especially those items inherited from my deceased mother. Those items are difficult to address  because I don&#39;t feel the same  way about them as my mother did.
I love this. &quot;Am I willing and able to take care of this?&quot; is another one I like to ask, whether it&#39;s a new purchase or something I might already own. In a way, every item you have is an added responsibility.
Yes, I tend to ask myself if I will/could possibly use something, since I already spent the money on it.  But that money is gone, and having a cluttery house is costing me my time, energy, peace and happiness.
Meeee?? I&#39;ve donated at least 35 trash bags of stuff this year, not including bigger items that wouldn&#39;t fit. So much better to have less
I can live without curtains but it makes me very sad. I can live without books but they bring me a lot of joy. I can live without many things like lotion, shampoo etc but I feel more comfortable having them.  I am glad you found something that works for you, but it wouldn?™t work for me. I am reducing clutter at the moment and for me looking at things and asking myself whether they bring me joy works better
Thank you very much for a new mantra &quot; CAN I LIVE WITHOUT IT?&quot;. I use to say &quot;Less is better&quot;, but I LOVE yours better. Thank you again. ??
Getting rid of things is so freeing! It&#39;s crazy how much clutter creates chaos and stress, the excessive stuff owns us. With 5 kids I am constantly getting rid of stuff.
For nostalgia items, a good trick is to take a picture of the item. Makes it easier to choose to let go of some things that are overly kept because they&#39;re sentimental. Not the family heirlooms, of course, but minor things.
Thank you! A seemingly small &#39;tweak&#39; in our thinking can make a HUGE difference.
To me, the key is in having everything you need and nothing you don?™t, and then making sure that everything you have, has a home. That way, all you have to do is make sure you put things back in their home when you?™re done with them and your house stays pretty tidy.
Growing up, my dad always taught me &quot;Do I Need this or do I Want this?&quot; This has always stuck with me til this day. And help me save money and be conscious of what I buy.
Thank you for sharing this! I find the &quot;do I need this?&quot; question to be a black hole of excuses that just leads to frustration and overwhelm. I&#39;m going to implement this!
